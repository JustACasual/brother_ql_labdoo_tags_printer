# Brother QL Labdoo Tags Printer

The idea of this script is to automatically print in a Brother QL Label printer the Tags for Dootronics of Labdoo

The idea would be

1. Read configurations parameters of a file
2. Read the tags needed to print of a file
Loop
3. Look for the tag in Labdoo.org
4. Create the images Dootronic - Power Supply - Battery
5. Print the Tags
6. Clean Up

It is still a mock-up if working improvementes will come
